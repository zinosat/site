# Install Instructions

** WARNING: these instructions are by no means complete, feel free to ask in the
[Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ygssH9x) if you encounter any problems.
As we are still in early test stages.**

# Get AnnePro2 Tools

0. Install the latest stable `rust` toolchain using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
0. Download or Clone the [AnnePro2-Tools](https://github.com/OpenAnnePro/AnnePro2-Tools) project.
0. Compile the tool using
```bash
cargo build --release
```
0. The compiled tool should be in `./target/release/annepro2_tools` (In later I will refer to this as `annepro2_tools`)

# Get QMK firmware
*Hint: If you are on windows, I recommend completing this step using WSL. YMMV*
0. Clone our fork of the QMK firmware by using the command below. (Install Git if needed)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenAnnePro/qmk_firmware.git annepro-qmk --recursive --depth 1
```
0. Obtain the `gcc-arm-none-eabi` toolchain so you can build the project.
0. To compile the firmware type
```bash
# For C15 Revision
make annepro2/c15
# For C18 Revision
make annepro2/c18
```
This should compelte without any error. And you should be able to see a file named
`annepro2_c15(18)_default.bin` in your directory.

# Flashing the firmware
0. Put the keyboard into DFU/IAP mode.
0. Run anndpro2_tools with the firmware you just built.
**Please subsitute with correct path**
```bash
annepro2_tools annepro2_c15_default.bin
```
If you have the C18 revision, you will need to add `-p 8009` to the argument list
in order to specify 0x8009 as the USB product ID. If this reports can't find device
please double check you have the keyboard in IAP mode. We have found out some version
of the bootloader only show one interface, which require the use of `--loosy` argument
to use the first interface found on the device with `0x04d9:8009` vid pid pair.

Once the tool has completed, you can simply replug the keyboard to activate the firmware.

Enjoy!
